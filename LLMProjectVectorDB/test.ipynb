PUBLIC INTEREST STATEMENT \\nIn recent times, finance experts, researchers and \\nregulators are concerned about the cryptocur -\\nrency “Bitcoin” and the incessant erratic swings in \\nits price. This paper offers an explanation to what \\nmay cause the sporadic volatility in the price of \\nBitcoin. Unlike typical financial assets, such as \\ncommodities, bonds, stocks, for which price \\nswings are largely determined by fundamentals \\n(of demand and supply), the volatility of Bitcoin \\nprice is affected by information search on social \\nnetwork. Hence, we employed the ARDL model \\nand its Bounds testing approach to confirm how \\nthe volatility of Bitcoin price response to funda -\\nmentals as Bitcoin transaction volume and price, \\nas well as other factors as world market equity \\nindex and the information (Google) search. We \\nfound strong evidence that fundamentals drive \\nerratic swing in Bitcoin price than information.\\nGbadebo et al., Cogent Business & Management (2021), 8: 1984624\\nhttps://doi.org/10.1080/23311975.2021.1984624\\nPage 1 of 21Received: 08 December 2020 \\nAccepted: 16 September 2021\\n*Corresponding author: Ahmed \\nOluwatobi Adekunle, Department of \\nAccounting and Finance, Kwara State \\nUniversity, Ilorin, Nigeria \\nE-mail: tobiahamed@gmail.com\\nAdditional information is available at \\nthe end of the article\\n© 2021 The Author(s).

Like traditional money, \\nBTC serves as medium of payments, exchange for alternative cryptocurrencies or fiat currencies \\nbut remained uncoordinated by monetary policy of the Reserve Banks (Aalborg et al., 2018 ; \\nMikhaylov, 2020 ).\\nBTC is likewise considered as an investment product. Kurka (2019 ) argued that the turbulence in \\nstock and commodity markets motivates investors to seek alternative investment. The Bitcoin’s lack \\nof correlation with traditional assets makes it an attractive option in its fast developing market. With \\nrecent formal launch of Bitcoin standardize futures in regulated exchanges, some institutional \\ninvestors and experts now deliberate BTC as a safe haven or a hedge option (Hughes et al., 2019 ; \\nKharpal, 2020 ). The huge investment in Bitcoin drives significant increases in the number of estab -\\nlished decentralized exchange (DEX) that serve as platforms for trading the coins (Kristoufek, 2018 ). \\nThese platforms and market are largely dominated by technology enthusiasts, liberalist traders (Silva \\net al., 2019 ), and, fraudsters taking advantages of unsophisticated P2P participants.\\nThe BTC transactions are managed on an open-source system “Blockchain” which applies sophis -\\nticated protocol to generate, record, and verify transactions (Smales, 2019 ). There are 21 million BTCs \\nassumed to be configured in its algorithm’s reserve and an estimated 84% have been mined. The \\nsupply is projected to have lost about 20% tokens, which unlike fiat money cannot be reprinted or \\nreturn to circulation (Nathan, 2019 ). The limited supply, irrecoverable loss and increase in transaction \\nhave implications for its swings. Since inception the price of BTC has swing with unpredictable ups and \\ndowns movements meted with strong resistance, supports, breakthrough, jumps, consolidations, and \\ncorrections in different price episodes. The price of bitcoin increase by over 2000%, and reportedly \\npeaked around $19,400 in December, 2017. By July 2018, it has declined to $12,500 and stood at \\n$7200 in December 2019. The volatility continues and the price has experience massive run-up, \\nreversal and consolidates around $40,000 in July 2021.\\nThe extreme volatility of BTC price has attracted much growing interests among experts. \\nEconomists suppose that Bitcoin and its fundamentals differ from those of convention assets as \\nstocks, bonds or foreign exchanges because Bitcoin is not a corporation. There is no known balance \\nsheets, at least at the moment, to review before making decision to invest in Bitcoin, “stablecoins” \\nor alternative DeFi assets. Hence, the volatility of Bitcoin is influenced by factors such as the \\nsupply-demand for Bitcoin, as much as spillover of alternative cryptocurrencies. As noted by \\nGuizani and Nafti (2019 ), the excessive fluctuation in Bitcoin price is occasioned by increase \\ndemand, short-term noises, news shock, sophisticated traders trend chasers), naïve traders, and \\nspeculators. Some empirical evidence attributed the fluctuation in BTC price to simply supply- \\ndemand fundamentals, its returns (Dufour & Engle, 2000 ; Jain & Jiang, 2014 ; Julio, 2017 ; Guizani & \\nNafti, 2019 ) and information search on Bitcoin (Kjærland et al., 2018 ).\\nIn this paper, we attempt to respond to the pertinent issue on “what explains erratic swings in BTC \\nprice?” We provide more insights to this incessant debates by dichotomizing the drivers of Bitcoin \\nprice volatility into market “fundamentals” and “information demand”. The paper advance literature \\nin empirical finance by analyzing within the framework of dynamic modelling that market forces such \\nas price, volume and network search for the word “bitcoin” are the factors that explains the volatility \\nGbadebo et al., Cogent Business & Management (2021), 8: 1984624                                                                                                                                 \\nhttps://doi.org/10.1080/23311975.2021.1984624\\nPage 2 of 21in the price of Bitcoin. The rest of the study is organized such that sections 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6, \\nrespectively, present the BTC price trends, empirical review, methodology, results and conclusions.\\n2.BTC price trends\\nThe BTC price has sporadically increase and associated with high volatility. In 2009, BTC trades for \\nalmost nothing as there was no exchange for the coin. In 6 February 2010 the first official Bitcoin \\nExchange was launched. As reported (Bitcoinwiki, 2014 ) in March 2010, a user could not sell \\n10,000BTCs auction for $50. On 22 May 2010 Bitcoin was first sold online at $0.0025—an historic \\npurchase of Domino’s pizza for 10,000BTCs at $25. By July 12, the price increased to $0.008, and \\nlater rose 1000% from $0.008 to $0.08 by July 17. In January 2011, the price rose to $0.30, and \\nbecame par with the US dollar in February. The price rose to $31.50 on June 8, and declined to \\n$11.00 in July and $5.27 at the end of December, 2011.\\nIn 2012, the price which started at $5.27 grew to $7.38 by January 9, crashed later to $3.80, and \\nconsolidated around $13.30 gaining about 154% in December. In March 2013 the first Bitcoin \\nregulation was issued by the US Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) as guidelines for \\npersons administering or exchanging Bitcoin. Within few weeks, the BTC market capitalisation \\nreached $1bn and Bitcoin moves above $500. BTC hits $770 in January 2014 but fell to $314 at \\nDecember, 2014 and to $434 at end of 2015.\\nIn 2016, the price spiked to $998, and experience spectacular increase up to $2800 in August, \\n2017. The price protruded over 1350% to a peak of $19,783.06 on 17 December 2017, making \\nsome institutional investors like the US Chicago Board Options Exchange] to launched Bitcoin \\nfutures and began to offered daily contracts on Bitcoins futures. The unprecedented spike \\ndecreased about 45% to begin at $13,412.44 on 1 January 2018. By October 31, bitcoin price \\nhas declined to $6,300. The price could not hold on the $6,000 rally during a low volatility era, \\nhence fall to $4,000 in November. The BTC price steadily rose to $8721 by May 29 and later to \\n$12,500 in July. In 2019, BTC price which started with $3700 steadily rose and stood at $7200 by \\nDecember 31. The increase and volatility continues and by November 2020, as reported (CME \\nGroup, 2021 ; Finance.yahoo.com, 2021 ; Reuter Staff, 2017 ), the price rallied above $18,000 gaining \\nall losses from previous peak.\\nSince mid-2020, the role of information tweet in influencing the price of bitcoin price has been \\nmore pronounced. The September’s announcement by Canton of Zug (Switzerland) to accept tax \\npayments and Elon Musk’s tweet to accept bitcoin for Tesla’s car purchase caused bitcoin price to \\nskyrocket beyond previous 2017 peak (Browne, 2021 ). Tesla’s purchase of bitcoins of USD \\n$1.5 billion and announced plans to accept BTC for vehicle payment on 8 February 2021 pushed \\nthe bitcoin price to $44,141 (Li, 2021 ). Bitcoin worth over $62,000 USD in both February 2021 and \\nApril 2021 due to events and information which involve Tesla and Coinbase announcements. In \\nsame period, the Bitcoin market capitalisation reached its all-time high of over $1 trillion, and had \\nsince decline roughly around $600 billion in June 2021. At the moment, the price has \\nrevolved around $40,000.00 in late July, 2021.\\nFigure A1(a–f) represents plots for the observed daily Bitcoin price (01\\\\0115–11\\\\01\\\\21), and for \\ntwo different episodes (01\\\\0115–30\\\\06\\\\19) and (01\\\\0719–11\\\\01\\\\2021), as well as, for the first \\ndifference and for log daily price and log-difference price. The plots show that the price follows \\na nonlinear pattern. Bitcoin volatility reached about 8% in a 90 days span between October 2017 \\nand January of 2018. This is twice its volatility in a 28-day period from 17 December 2019 to \\n13 January 2020.\\n3.Empirical review\\nMost empirical literature on Bitcoin focus on: BTC price formation, relationship between BTC and \\nfinancial market assets, BTC as speculative bubbles, BTC shares in cryptocurrency market with \\nalternative crypto-asset, BTC time-of-day periodicities of trading, and the estimation of BTC price \\nGbadebo et al., Cogent Business & Management (2021), 8: 1984624                                                                                                                                 \\nhttps://doi.org/10.1080/23311975.2021.1984624                                                                                                                                                       \\nPage 3 of 21volatility. Some papers discuss factors that drive BTC price as macroeconomic and financial \\ndevelopment (Pyo & Lee, 2020 ); technology (Kjærland et al., 2018 ; Li & Wang, 2017 ) and the \\nmarket efficiency (Nadarajah & Chu, 2017 ).\\nOn relation with traditional assets, some studies (Bouri et al., 2018 ; Kurka, 2019 ; Smales, 2019 ) \\nclaim BTC holdings doe not serve as a safe haven for global assets, while Bouoiyour and Selmi \\n(2015 ) support that BTC serves as a safe haven, and hedges for oil price fluctuation. Matkovskyy \\nand Jalan (2019 ) argued that during financial crisis, risk-averse investors avoid Bitcoins as it is \\nconsidered riskier than other assets. Ji et al. (2019 ) argued that the attractiveness of Bitcoin is \\na major determinant of other cryptocurrencies. Some authors (Baur et al., 2018 ; Cheah & Fry, 2015 ; \\nCorbet et al., 2018 ) claimed that BTC is a speculative bubbles as its fundamental value cannot be \\nestimated or is equal to zero. Goutte et al. (2019 ) and Jeon et al. (2020 ) provided a survey on the \\nmechanisms of BTC exchange and crypto-finance, while Troster et al. (2018 ) analysed the implica -\\ntions of volatility for the BTC market. Some studies (Acharya et al., 2018 ; Baur et al., 2019 ; Eross \\net al., 2019 ; Koopman et al., 2005 ; O’Hara, 2015 ) focused on time-of-day periodicities of trading in \\nExchanges. Urquhart (2018 ) focused on the examination of price clustering, while some studies \\n(Hung et al., 2020 ; Troster et al., 2018 ) focused on the estimation of volatility models.\\nAvailable evidence (Aalborg et al., 2018 ; Cebrián-H & Jiménez-Rodríguez, 2021 ; Guizani & Nafti, \\n2019 ; Ji et al., 2019 ; Kjærland et al., 2018 ; Liang et al., 2020 ; Poyser, 2017 ; Wijk, 2013 ) discuss the \\ndeterminants of BTC price (BTCV) volatility. Wijk (2013 ) analysed the impact of macroeconomic- \\nand financial development factors on BTCV. He checks the impact of exchange rates, oil price and \\nmarket indices as Equity index, Dow-Jones index and Nikkei index on price volatility. The results \\nshows negative effects for oil price and Nikkei index, but positive effects both Equity index and DJ \\nindex on BTC price variability.\\nPoyser (2017 ) applied the Bayesian structural approach to analyse the effect of investor’s \\nsentiments, gold, and stock index on BTC price volatility. The results showed that the volatility \\nrelates positively with USD/Euro rate, stock index and difference among countries’ search trends, \\nwhile negatively associated with gold price, investor’s sentiment and Yuan/USD rate. Yechen et al. \\n(2017 ) applied a Vector error correction on monthly data to explain how BTC price volatility \\ndepends on custom price index, US dollar index, Dow jones index, Federal funds rate and gold \\nprice. They found that all variables have a long-term influence. Trade volume has positive effect on \\nBTC volatility price. The US dollar index is the biggest influencer, while gold is the least.\\nKjærland et al. (2018 ) applied the Autoregressive Distributed Lag (ARDL) model and generalized \\nautoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity (GARCH) approach to examine BTC price volatility. \\nThey identified that technological factor “Hashrate” is immaterial in modelling BTC price dynamics, \\nand verify the effect of Google searches, returns on S&P 500, volatility (VIX) index, oil price, gold \\nprice and BTC transaction volume on BTC prices. The Google searches and returns on S&P 500 have \\npositive and significant effect on BTC price volatility, while VIX, oil, gold, and volume to be \\ninsignificant. Aalborg et al. (2018 ) analysed the effect of transaction volume, VIX index and \\nGoogle searches for “Bitcoin” on the prediction of volatility of BTC price. They applied realized \\nvolatility computed from high-frequency data and found that the autoregressive model is suitable \\nfor BTC volatility. The trading volume variable shows a positive effect on the volatility model.\\nJi et al. (2019 ) explained the system of BTC exchanges relative to their common dynamics. They \\nconsidered the connectedness measures based on the daily realised volatility of BTC price. They \\nhypothesized that the positions of specific exchanges within the cryptocurrency network connect -\\nedness seems to be driven by individual’s exchange’s unique characteristics. The paper employed \\nhigh-frequency data that results reveal that while Binance exchange ranks is weak, the exchange \\n“Coinbase” leads the crypto market. The paper concluded that asset withdrawal explains more of \\nthe price volatility amongst individual exchanges than the trade volume.\\nGbadebo et al., Cogent Business & Management (2021), 8: 1984624                                                                                                                                 \\nhttps://doi.org/10.1080/23311975.2021.1984624\\nPage 4 of 21Guizani and Nafti (2019 ) explain the reason for excessive BTC price volatility. The paper employs \\nthe ARDL and the Granger causality on daily time series to dynamically explain how number of BTC \\naddresses, attractiveness indicator, mining difficulty, transaction volume, stock and EUR/USD rate, \\nmacroeconomic and financial development affect Bitcoin price volatility. The result suggests that \\nthe number of addresses and the mining difficulty have a significant impact on the BTC price \\nvolatility. The stock, the exchange rate, transaction volume and the macroeconomic and financial \\ndevelopment do not determine the price of the BTC in the short- and long term.\\nLiang et al. (2020 ) applied GARCH-MIDAS model to analyse the impact of VIX, Google Trends, and \\nGPR on bitcoin price and provide strong evidence that Google Trends exhibits strongest predict -\\nability for Bitcoin volatility over other competing predictors. Cebrián-H and Jiménez-Rodríguez \\n(2021 ) applied GARCH and multivariate GARCH (MGARCH) between 1 January 2011 and \\n31 December 2018 to consider the role of Gold, Brent oil, exchange rates, S&P500, Nikkei 225, \\nVISA and MasterCard transaction, Riot Blockchain, Nvidia on bitcoin prices. He discovered that \\nthere exist conditional correlation between the volatility of VISA, MasterCard, Riot Blockchain, \\nNvidia and Bitcoin, but not with the traditional assets as oil and gold.\\n4.Data and methodology\\n4.1. The data\\nThe data for this study are obtained from four sources: www.Google.trends.com , www.bitcoincharts. \\ncom ; www.nasdaq.com ; and www.Blockchain.com . In line with some studies (Aalborg et al., 2018 ; Ji \\net al., 2019 ; Kjærland et al., 2018 ; Yechen et al., 2017 ), we applied monthly data between 2013M6 and \\n2021M6. The bitcoin price adopted is the simple unweighted average of monthly closing price. We \\nfocused on the periods for which the volume of bitcoin transaction was considerably increased \\n(Kjærland et al., 2018 ), and the digital coin has gained attractions. Prior to June 2013, the attraction \\nand transactions volume of bitcoin were relatively low (Guizani & Nafti, 2019 ).\\nUnlike some studies (Dwyer, 2015 ; Kjærland et al., 2018 ; Wang et al., 2019 ) that considered \\nblockchain technology factor such as “Hash Rates” as determinant of bitcoin prices volatility, we \\nfocus solely on the effects of markets fundamental and information demand for the cryptocur -\\nrency. In sum, we employ Bitcoin price, Transaction volume, World market equity index, \\nCryptocurrency market capitalization, Information demands and the Bitcoin price volatility. The \\nvariables are in log form in accordance with analogous Bitcoin study by Pyo and Lee (2020 ). The \\nlogarithmic transformations are done to ensure that the cointegration relationship is preserved \\nwhile the heteroscedasticity is eliminated series. We discuss each variable in details.\\n4.1.1. Market fundamentals \\nThe supply and demand for Bitcoin, like other assets in the financial market and foreign exchange \\nmarket are the two main market fundamentals of price formations. Li and Wang (2017 ) notes that \\nthe demand indicator for BTCs have greater implication for its fluctuation than its reserves fixed \\nsupply. We follow some theoretical models on a positive relation between price volatility and \\ntrading volume in the financial markets. The common ones amongst these models are “mixture of \\ndistributions” models. Taylor (2017 ), “asymmetric information” models and “differences in opi-\\nnion” models. According to the “asymmetric information” models, investors submit trades based \\non available private information. As noted by Bian, Chan and Selgin (2015 ) as informed investors \\nincrease trade volume, volatility increases due to information generated. The literature on the \\n“differences in opinion” approach propound that relatively homogeneous beliefs drives excess \\nprice-volatility and excess volume, in relation to a more stable value of the asset.\\nUnlike asymmetric information, the proponents of the approach establishe that volatility-volume \\nconnection depends on who generates the volume, and why they are trading. Informed traders \\ntend to buy and sell within a relatively stable range of prices about the equilibrium value. Bian \\nfound that a positive volatility-volume relation is driven by the public investors in the futures \\nGbadebo et al., Cogent Business & Management (2021), 8: 1984624                                                                                                                                 \\nhttps://doi.org/10.1080/23311975.2021.1984624                                                                                                                                                       \\nPage 5 of 21markets for assets. For Bitcoin volatility-volume relation, found that the ability for investors to \\nwithdraw asset impacts more on the volatility through various Exchanges and trading volume. \\nBoth theoretical and empirical studies have focused on investigating the sources volatility-price \\nrelation and intraday price variations (Jiang et al., 2019 ). These models are based on market \\nmicrostructure that explore the mechanics of price formation and its relevance to market volatility. \\nThe model suggests that traditional volatility models can be augmented with the time-series of the \\ndaily price.\\nJiang et al. (2019 ) used a panel VAR estimation to examine the importance of price impact \\nresulting from the order book predicting stock volatility. They found that the price impact at the \\ndaily level is a major determinant of stock volatility dynamics. When the traditional volatility \\nmodels was augmented with the time-series of daily price impact, the volatility becomes more \\naccurately predicted at the one-day ahead forecasting horizon. The inclusion of the price variable \\nis needful as it as well helps improve the robustness of the model. Hence, as with some recent \\nnotable studies (Guizani & Nafti, 2019 ; Kjærland et al., 2018 ), we use BTC transaction volume \\n(TVOL) and BTC price (BTCP) as proxies for its fundamentals. We expect both BTCP and TVOL to \\nhave positive impact on Bitcoin price volatility.\\n4.1.2. Market capitalisation \\nThe market capitalization is a major factor that affects cryptocurrencies. Market capitalization is \\nobtained by multiplying the total number of Bitcoins in circulation by its own price. Lansky (2016 ) \\nconsidered the role of market capitalisation in in influencing the price of major cryptocurrencies. \\nYhlas (2018 ) applied an index of market capitalisation for 50 selected top coins. We would expect \\nthat a higher market capitalisation would provide a good chance for traders to get hands over \\nhigher profits. We use MCAP as proxies for cryptocurrencies market capitalization.\\n4.1.3. World market (equity) index \\nSome papers explain how volatility in globally asset markets transfer between markets and countries. \\nThese authors (Aalborg et al., 2018 ; Cebrián-H & Jiménez-Rodríguez, 2021 ; Guizani & Nafti, 2019 ; \\nJulio, 2017 ) incorporate financial development index or world market index—an indication of overall \\nglobal state of markets, which is expected to stimulate demand, hence causes increase in volatility. \\nSome studies applied the Equity index as Dow-Jones (DJ) index (Liang et al., 2020 ; Wijk, 2013 ; Yechen \\net al., 2017 ) and Nikkei 225 (Cebrián-H & Jiménez-Rodríguez, 2021 ; Poyser, 2017 ; Wijk, 2013 ), but we \\nincorporate the Morgan Stanley Capital International (MSCI)’s All Country World Index proxy as ACWI. \\nThe ACWI is a capitalization-weighted index, covering over 3,000 stocks, that measures global equity \\nperformance capturing both developed and emerging markets. We expect the ACWI to have positive \\nhigher impact on Bitcoin price volatility.\\n4.1.4. Information demands \\nInformation shock causes BTC price to spike beyond values consistent with fundamentals within \\nminutes of disclosure. Some empirical studies (Kjærland et al., 2018 ; Li & Wang, 2017 ; Poyser, \\n2017 ) considered how BTCV is affected by social network, news and search queries. Luu and Huynh \\napplied VAR and SVAR to confirm the role of ‘bad news and moving patterns on the spillover risks \\namongst cryptocurrency markets. While Pak and Paroubek (2010 ) and Abraham et al. (2018 ) focus \\non twitter tweets as a major source of information demand, we work in line with studies (Liang \\net al., 2020 ) that focus on Google search. In line with these authors, we verify how frequency of \\nqueries for the word “bitcoin” on Google-Trend explains erratic swings in its price. The Google \\nTrend reports the amount of search queries relative to the total amount of Google searches over \\ntime. This method generates values that are normalized on a scale from zero to 100.\\nWe favour the use of Google trend for two reasons. First, although both Google trend and Twitter \\ntweets show strong correlation with bitcoin prices but unlike Google trend tweets may fluctuate \\nwith prices in a different directions Abraham et al. (2018 ). The Google search is established to \\nexhibit strongest predictability for Bitcoin volatility over other competing search predictors (Liang \\nGbadebo et al., Cogent Business & Management (2021), 8: 1984624                                                                                                                                 \\nhttps://doi.org/10.1080/23311975.2021.1984624\\nPage 6 of 21et al., 2020 ). Second, as reported (Clement, 2020 ) Google accounted for 87.35% of global market \\nshares of search engine as of January, 2018. We expect high information search (IFOD) to have \\npositive impact on Bitcoin price volatility.\\n4.1.5. Bitcoin price volatility \\nWe adopt the historical volatility to compute the realised volatility for each month of our data span \\nusing available daily bitcoin price. Historical volatility is measured by applying ‘summing squared \\ndaily returns within each month. This method which applies the daily data BTCP dCt to compute \\nvolatility reduces the possibility of error of approximations and gives the accurate representation \\nand serves as guide for investors and analysts (Boyte-White, 2020 ). To obtain the volatility we first \\ncompute the daily BTCP returns series with BTCR dCt\\x88BTCP dCtEBTCP dCt\\x001\\x00 �\\nand use same calculate \\nthe realised volatility as summing squared daily returns within a 21-day time horizon defined \\nas: BTCV mCt\\x88∑n\\x8821\\nt\\x881BTCR dCt��2.\\nTable 1 presents a summary of variables for the empirical model.\\n4.2. The methodology\\nThis study estimates the relationship between the volatility of bitcoin prices and their attendant \\n(explanatory) variables. As applied in previous studies (Bariviera, 2017 ; Guizani & Nafti, 2019 ; \\nKjærland et al., 2018 ; Lahmiri et al., 2018 ), we adopt a Transfer-function —the Autoregressive \\nDistributed Lag, (ARDL) model which regresses the lag(s) of BTCV on contemporaneous BTCV. \\nThis model helps to apply monthly data to examine the short- and long-run factors that influence \\nprices of cryptocurrencies between 2013:M6 and 2021M6. Kjærland et al. (2018 ) employed the \\nARDL to show how the technological “Hashrate”, Google searches and BTC return influence Bitcoin \\nprice volatility. Guizani and Nafti (2019 ) adopted same to show how the number of BTC addresses, \\ntransaction volume and stocks drive BTC price volatility. The ARDL is considered as the major \\nworkhorse in dynamic single-equation estimation. We apply the ARDL, as well as its (cointegration) \\nBounds test to analyse how bitcoin market Fundamentals and Information demands explain the \\nerratic fluctuations in BTC prices. We summarise our estimation procedure in five steps.\\nFirst, we present statistics and verify the stochastic property of the data generating process \\n(DSG) with a unit root test for each time series (zt). We apply Augmented–Dickey–Fuller (ADF); \\nElliott–Rothenberg–Stock (ERS)’s DF–GLS, & Kwiatkowski–Phillips–Schmidt–Shin (KPSS) test.Table 1.

In estimating (6) we ignores the “l(1)-ness” of the series and estimate the \\nnonstationary series with least squares (Pesaran & Shin, 1999 ).\\nGbadebo et al., Cogent Business & Management (2021), 8: 1984624                                                                                                                                 \\nhttps://doi.org/10.1080/23311975.2021.1984624\\nPage 8 of 21Third , once we estimate (6), the next step is to verify if a long-run (equilibrium or cointegra -\\ntion) relationship exists amongst the l(0) or l(1) variables. We apply the ARDL (Cointegration) \\nBounds test procedure developed by Pesaran and Shin (1999 ), Pesaran et al. (2001 ), and \\nPesaran et al. (2001 ) introduce two (bounds) tests for cointegration: an F-test on the joint \\nnull that the coefficients on the level variables are jointly equal to zero or a t-test on the \\nlagged level dependent variable. In order to rule out the possibilities of degenerate cases and \\nobtain valid conclusion, both the F and t- test work under the that assumption the dependent \\nvariable is l(1). We adopt the F-test for our study. The bounds test check for cointegration by \\nestimating (a reparameterised) regression for Δyt:\\nΔyt\\x88β0\\x87φiyt\\x00i\\x87∑m\\nj\\x881φ�\\niΔyt\\x00i\\x87∑m\\nj\\x881βjxjCt\\x00i\\x87∑m\\nj\\x880γjCiB\\x85\\x86ΔxjCt\\x00i\\x87at (7) \\nThe test null H0Bφ\\x88βj\\x880Cj\\x881tom� �\\nis no cointegration exist.

The model expresses the current \\nchange in the endogenous variable, Δyt as a linear function of the current change in the exogen -\\nous variable Δxt and a proportion of the previous error from the long-run “equilibrium”, ECM t\\x001. The \\nβj6s denote the long-run coefficients which represent the equilibrium effects of the xt on change in \\nthe dependent variable, Δyt. The γjCi’s are the short-run coefficients which account for fluctuations \\nthat are not determined by deviations from the long-run equilibrium. The (sign and) absolute value \\nof μ indicates the speed of adjustment. The t–statistic test on coefficients of the short run, γjCishows \\nthe impact of each variables on the dependent variable in the short run. We apply the least \\nsquares to estimate our models using the coefficient covariance method of HAC.\\nFifth since the ARDL equation comprises of l(1) variable(s), as argued by Borensztein et al. (1998 ), \\nit is required to check for heteroscedasticity and the serial correlation. To test the stability of the \\nlong run parameters estimates, we use the Cumulative Sum (CUSUM) and the Cumulative Sum of \\nSquare (CUSUMSQ) tests. This same procedure was relied on by Pesaran and Pesaran (Pesaran \\net al., 2001 ) to test the stability of the long-run coefficients. We check for existence of two \\nsignificant structural breakpoints using the Chow break point test. The first in December, 2017, \\nwhen the Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE) launched bitcoin futures contracts and \\nthe second is January, 2020, when the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) Group, the world’s \\nlargest derivatives exchange launch Bitcoin Options on its Bitcoin futures contracts.\\n5.The results\\n5.1. Descriptive statistics\\nTables 2 and Tables 3 present the descriptive statistics and the covariance-correlation matrix, respec -\\ntively. The result shows that the log of bitcoin price has a mean of 3.328 and a standard deviation of \\n0.768. Aside the bitcoin price and transaction volume, all the logarithmic distribution for other \\nvariables are asymmetric (positively skewed). The excess kurtosis for the price volatility and other \\nvariables aside the ACWI (with value slightly less than 2) suggests leptokurtic distribution for all series. \\nThe probability values for the Jarque Bera statistics for all variables show that all the series are not \\nGbadebo et al., Cogent Business & Management (2021), 8: 1984624                                                                                                                                 \\nhttps://doi.org/10.1080/23311975.2021.1984624                                                                                                                                                       \\nPage 9 of 21normally distributed, hence rejecting the normality null. This validate reported asymmetry and a sign \\nfor nonstationary, which would be confirmed by the unit root tests.\\nIn Table 3, there is high positive correlation between bitcoin price volatility and fundamentals, as \\nwell as between volatility of price and information, in line with findings by Bariviera (2017 ), \\nCebrián-H and Jiménez-Rodríguez (2021 ), and Cebrián-H and Jiménez-Rodríguez (2021 ) establish \\nconditional correlation between the volatility of Bitcoin and attendant variables as MasterCard, \\nRiot Blockchain, Nvidia index. The bitcoin determinants (price, volume, market capitalisation, equity \\nindex, information demands) are likely to have gain values as much as the bitcoin attract \\nattentions.\\n5.2. Unit root test\\nTable 4 presents the unit root test results. The unit root test applied Equations (1)–(3) to obtain τμ, \\nττ, and τη, respectively. The results indicate that aside two of the variables (bitcoin price volatility \\nand the world market equity index), there is enough evidence to conclude at 1 percent signifi -\\ncance level that other series (zt) are differenced stationary and l(1). For both ADF and DF-GLS test \\nprotocols, the null are accepted, while with the KPSS tests, the nulls of stationarity is rejected. The \\nevidence supports that first differenced (Δzt) are stationary for ADF and DF-GLS. This is not \\nsurprising as we would normally expect volatility, which is an offshoots of differencing not to \\nbe trended even for large swings. In the cryptocurrency market, unprecedented volatility are \\nconnected to reactions to information shocks. The existence of such headline-making bitcoin Table 2.

The result shows the vola -\\ntility of bitcoin price would be expected to increase by approximately 0.7% when markets \\nfundamentals (prices and volume vagaries) and information are not drivers of price swings. As \\nwould be expected bitcoin prices, transaction volume and market capitalisation are properly \\nsigned and significant in line with finding by Kjærland et al. (2018 ), and the information demands \\nis well signed and significant similar to finding by Poyser (2017 ). However, the all country world \\nindex was signed contrary to positive expectation and is not significant. This is contrary to findings \\nby Wijk (2013 ) who shows that the Dow jones index has positive effects on BTC price variability, \\nand Yechen et al. (2017 ) who established that both trade volume and Dow Jones index have \\npositive influence on bitcoin price volatility.\\nAll month-pasts bitcoin price volatility, bitcoin price and transactions volume in the parsimo -\\nnious model have negative effects on its contemporaneous price volatility value and not signifi -\\ncant, except for the previous bitcoin price. This indicates that the past play lesser roles in \\ninfluencing the contemporaneous value bitcoin price volatility. The significance of one-month \\npasts in previous prices imply that its effect on contemporaneous price volatility has not \\nwaned away.Table 5.

As would be seen a 1% change in the \\nprice of bitcoin and volume lead to approximately 0.241% and 0.04% change, respectively, in the \\nvolatility of price, as against the 0.002% occasioned by information demands. The accompanying \\nconfidence intervals for estimates are also properly signed within acceptable positive ranges. All \\nstandardise coefficient maintain their earlier signs validating that bitcoin price and volume exert \\ngreater swings on volatility than information search. The overall model is highly significant at 1% \\nand the predictive power (�R2) of 90% is high. The purpose of this paper is to examine the response \\nof Bitcoin price volatility to market fundamentals and information, test of significance of the \\noverall model is important rather than predictive ability of the model through fundamentals and \\ninformation.\\n5.4. ARDL cointegration (bounds) test\\nThe bounds test check for cointegration amongst variables in (7) with a reparameterised regres -\\nsion. The estimation process eliminate all insignificant lags. Using the AIC the conditional ARDL(1, \\n1, 3, 0, 0, 0) is selected from all possible test equations. The results reported in Table 7 show that \\nthe F-statistic (18.679) is greater than the l(1) bounds, hence provides strong evidence to reject the \\nno cointegration null.

Aside changes in the equity \\nmarket index (ACWI) which was wrongly signed contrary to short run expectations, and the \\nchange in the one month past of the transaction volume, all the changes in the contemporaneous \\nvariables and the changes in their pasts are significant at 5%. This indicates bitcoin price, transac -\\ntion volume, and information demands explain changes in the volatility of bitcoin price in the short \\nrun. The findings correspond with earlier study by Kjærland et al.

A 1% increase in Bitcoin price and transactions volume lead to respectively, 0.44% and \\n0.29% increase in Bitcoin price volatility, all things being equal, while a 1% increase in information \\nsearch leads 0.21% increase in Bitcoin price swings.\\nThis findings support earlier position of Guizani and Nafti (2019 ) bitcoin price long-run position. \\nWe found that the world market index, which is supposed to stimulate demand has negative long- \\nrun effect on BTC price volatility. This may be attributed to the fact that the period covers has not \\nrecognised institution and regulation of the digital currency. Except for coefficient of world market \\nindex, kθ4, all other long-run coefficients are significant at 5%. As noted (Briere et al., 2015 ), \\na significance coefficient of world market index is an indication that there is protection to investors \\nwho want to limit their risk exposure. There is at least 97% confidence that bitcoin price, transac -\\ntion volume, market capitalisation and information explains the volatility of Bitcoin price in the \\nlong run.\\n5.7. Robustness test\\nWe assess the appropriateness of the ARDL model by conducting some residual checks to verify \\ntheir randomness. We examined the structural stability of the long-run coefficients alongside the \\nshort-run dynamics. Our results confirm the adequacy of the estimation. Table 10 presents the \\nresult of the same robustness tests.\\nThe Breusch-Pagan-Godfrey test is not significant and hence support evidence that there is \\nabsence of heteroscedasticity. In addition, the Breusch-Godfrey test is not significant providing no \\nbasis to reject the no serially correlation null. With a p-value (0.526) the normality null of \\ndistributed stochastic errors is not rejected. The CUSUM plot in Figure A1 1(a) indicates structural \\nstability in the long run coefficients.

In effects, we checked the influence of price, transaction volume, \\nworld equity market index, market capitalisation and Google search on the volatility of Bitcoin \\nprice. Similar to Guizani and Nafti (2019 ), we observed a long-run equilibrium relationship between \\nBTC price volatility and attendant variables. We could not establish evidence that the volatility of Table 11.

The results indicate that while the \\nvolatility of BTC price response positively to market fundamentals [in line with Kjærland et al. \\n(2018 )] and information search on BTC [similar to Poyser (2017 )], the fundamentals exert more \\ninfluence on price fluctuations than search.\\nWe make three recommendations based on the outcome of this study. First is that stakeholders \\nin the cryptocurrency markets should embark on campaigns to encourage more institutional \\nacceptance. Second is that there should be increased regulation in order to curb excessive swings \\nthat may significantly affect funds invested in Bitcoin. Third is there should be establishment of \\na Bitcoin insurance in form of a Decentralised Insurance Product (DIP) that would assure investors \\nof the safety of funds invested in Bitcoin.\\nThis study opens rooms for future research. We limited our focus on the determinants of Bitcoin \\nprice volatility. We do not distinct Bitcoin as money or an asset, rather we considered bitcoin in this \\npaper as both a product in a currency exchange market or a security in an asset market. Future \\nresearch may make distinctions. There may be need to investigate the role of data frequency on \\nthe outcome. Future research may focus on infra-monthly data to confirm the sensitivity of Bitcoin \\nprice volatility to data periodicity.\\nFunding\\nThe authors received no direct funding for this research.\\nAuthor details\\nAdedeji Daniel Gbadebo1 \\nE-mail: gbadebo.adedejidaniel@gmail.com \\nAhmed Oluwatobi Adekunle2 \\nE-mail: tobiahamed@gmail.com \\nWole Adedokun4 \\nE-mail: woledokun@yahoo.com \\nAdebayo-Oke Abdulrauf Lukman5 \\nE-mail: okelukman2003@yahoo.com \\nJoseph Akande3 \\nE-mail: jakande@nust.na \\n1 Department of Economics and Statistics, University of \\nBenin, Benin City, Nigeria. \\n2 Depar tment of Accounting and Finance, Kwara State \\nUniversity, Ilorin, Nigeria. \\n3 Department of Accounting Science, Walter Sisulu \\nUniversity, Mthatha, South Africa. \\n4 Department of Accounting and Finance, Institute of \\nGraduate Studies and Research, Cyprus International \\nUniversity, Nicosia, Turkey. \\n5 Department of Accounting and Finance, Kwara State \\nUniversity, Ilorin, Nigeria.\\nCitation information \\nCite this article as: BTC price volatility: Fundamentals versus \\ninformation, Adedeji Daniel Gbadebo, Ahmed Oluwatobi \\nAdekunle, Wole Adedokun & Adebayo-Oke Abdulrauf \\nLukman , Cogent Business & Management (2021), 8: 1984624.\\nNote\\n1. ~βjCi is an input polynomial lag expressed \\nas:-\\n~βjB\\x85\\x86\\x88~βjC0\\x87~βjC1B\\x87~βjC2B2\\x87\\x87~βjCsj\\x001Bsj\\x001\\x88\\x00∑Sj\\nl\\x88i\\x871βjCl-\\nkβj\\x88kβjC0\\x87444\\x87kβjCsj; and εt\\x88φ\\x001B\\x85\\x86atLet \\nθ0\\x88φ\\x0011\\x85\\x86K0; θj\\x88φ\\x0011\\x85\\x86Kj1\\x85\\x86; \\n~θjB\\x85\\x86\\x88φ\\x001B\\x85\\x86~βjB\\x85\\x86\\x00~φB\\x85\\x86φ\\x0011\\x85\\x86Kj1\\x85\\x86� �\\n. \\nCompeting interests\\nThe author declare not competing interest.Disclosure statement\\nNo potential conflict of interest was reported by the author(s).\\nReferences\\nAalborg, H.

PUBLIC INTEREST STATEMENT \\nIn recent times, finance experts, researchers and \\nregulators are concerned about the cryptocur -\\nrency “Bitcoin” and the incessant erratic swings in \\nits price. This paper offers an explanation to what \\nmay cause the sporadic volatility in the price of \\nBitcoin. Unlike typical financial assets, such as \\ncommodities, bonds, stocks, for which price \\nswings are largely determined by fundamentals \\n(of demand and supply), the volatility of Bitcoin \\nprice is affected by information search on social \\nnetwork. Hence, we employed the ARDL model \\nand its Bounds testing approach to confirm how \\nthe volatility of Bitcoin price response to funda -\\nmentals as Bitcoin transaction volume and price, \\nas well as other factors as world market equity \\nindex and the information (Google) search. We \\nfound strong evidence that fundamentals drive \\nerratic swing in Bitcoin price than information.\\nGbadebo et al., Cogent Business & Management (2021), 8: 1984624\\nhttps://doi.org/10.1080/23311975.2021.1984624\\nPage 1 of 21Received: 08 December 2020 \\nAccepted: 16 September 2021\\n*Corresponding author: Ahmed \\nOluwatobi Adekunle, Department of \\nAccounting and Finance, Kwara State \\nUniversity, Ilorin, Nigeria \\nE-mail: tobiahamed@gmail.com\\nAdditional information is available at \\nthe end of the article\\n© 2021 The Author(s).

Like traditional money, \\nBTC serves as medium of payments, exchange for alternative cryptocurrencies or fiat currencies \\nbut remained uncoordinated by monetary policy of the Reserve Banks (Aalborg et al., 2018 ; \\nMikhaylov, 2020 ).\\nBTC is likewise considered as an investment product. Kurka (2019 ) argued that the turbulence in \\nstock and commodity markets motivates investors to seek alternative investment. The Bitcoin’s lack \\nof correlation with traditional assets makes it an attractive option in its fast developing market. With \\nrecent formal launch of Bitcoin standardize futures in regulated exchanges, some institutional \\ninvestors and experts now deliberate BTC as a safe haven or a hedge option (Hughes et al., 2019 ; \\nKharpal, 2020 ). The huge investment in Bitcoin drives significant increases in the number of estab -\\nlished decentralized exchange (DEX) that serve as platforms for trading the coins (Kristoufek, 2018 ). \\nThese platforms and market are largely dominated by technology enthusiasts, liberalist traders (Silva \\net al., 2019 ), and, fraudsters taking advantages of unsophisticated P2P participants.\\nThe BTC transactions are managed on an open-source system “Blockchain” which applies sophis -\\nticated protocol to generate, record, and verify transactions (Smales, 2019 ). There are 21 million BTCs \\nassumed to be configured in its algorithm’s reserve and an estimated 84% have been mined. The \\nsupply is projected to have lost about 20% tokens, which unlike fiat money cannot be reprinted or \\nreturn to circulation (Nathan, 2019 ). The limited supply, irrecoverable loss and increase in transaction \\nhave implications for its swings. Since inception the price of BTC has swing with unpredictable ups and \\ndowns movements meted with strong resistance, supports, breakthrough, jumps, consolidations, and \\ncorrections in different price episodes. The price of bitcoin increase by over 2000%, and reportedly \\npeaked around $19,400 in December, 2017. By July 2018, it has declined to $12,500 and stood at \\n$7200 in December 2019. The volatility continues and the price has experience massive run-up, \\nreversal and consolidates around $40,000 in July 2021.\\nThe extreme volatility of BTC price has attracted much growing interests among experts. \\nEconomists suppose that Bitcoin and its fundamentals differ from those of convention assets as \\nstocks, bonds or foreign exchanges because Bitcoin is not a corporation. There is no known balance \\nsheets, at least at the moment, to review before making decision to invest in Bitcoin, “stablecoins” \\nor alternative DeFi assets. Hence, the volatility of Bitcoin is influenced by factors such as the \\nsupply-demand for Bitcoin, as much as spillover of alternative cryptocurrencies. As noted by \\nGuizani and Nafti (2019 ), the excessive fluctuation in Bitcoin price is occasioned by increase \\ndemand, short-term noises, news shock, sophisticated traders trend chasers), naïve traders, and \\nspeculators. Some empirical evidence attributed the fluctuation in BTC price to simply supply- \\ndemand fundamentals, its returns (Dufour & Engle, 2000 ; Jain & Jiang, 2014 ; Julio, 2017 ; Guizani & \\nNafti, 2019 ) and information search on Bitcoin (Kjærland et al., 2018 ).\\nIn this paper, we attempt to respond to the pertinent issue on “what explains erratic swings in BTC \\nprice?” We provide more insights to this incessant debates by dichotomizing the drivers of Bitcoin \\nprice volatility into market “fundamentals” and “information demand”. The paper advance literature \\nin empirical finance by analyzing within the framework of dynamic modelling that market forces such \\nas price, volume and network search for the word “bitcoin” are the factors that explains the volatility \\nGbadebo et al., Cogent Business & Management (2021), 8: 1984624                                                                                                                                 \\nhttps://doi.org/10.1080/23311975.2021.1984624\\nPage 2 of 21in the price of Bitcoin. The rest of the study is organized such that sections 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6, \\nrespectively, present the BTC price trends, empirical review, methodology, results and conclusions.\\n2.BTC price trends\\nThe BTC price has sporadically increase and associated with high volatility. In 2009, BTC trades for \\nalmost nothing as there was no exchange for the coin. In 6 February 2010 the first official Bitcoin \\nExchange was launched. As reported (Bitcoinwiki, 2014 ) in March 2010, a user could not sell \\n10,000BTCs auction for $50. On 22 May 2010 Bitcoin was first sold online at $0.0025—an historic \\npurchase of Domino’s pizza for 10,000BTCs at $25. By July 12, the price increased to $0.008, and \\nlater rose 1000% from $0.008 to $0.08 by July 17. In January 2011, the price rose to $0.30, and \\nbecame par with the US dollar in February. The price rose to $31.50 on June 8, and declined to \\n$11.00 in July and $5.27 at the end of December, 2011.\\nIn 2012, the price which started at $5.27 grew to $7.38 by January 9, crashed later to $3.80, and \\nconsolidated around $13.30 gaining about 154% in December. In March 2013 the first Bitcoin \\nregulation was issued by the US Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) as guidelines for \\npersons administering or exchanging Bitcoin. Within few weeks, the BTC market capitalisation \\nreached $1bn and Bitcoin moves above $500. BTC hits $770 in January 2014 but fell to $314 at \\nDecember, 2014 and to $434 at end of 2015.\\nIn 2016, the price spiked to $998, and experience spectacular increase up to $2800 in August, \\n2017. The price protruded over 1350% to a peak of $19,783.06 on 17 December 2017, making \\nsome institutional investors like the US Chicago Board Options Exchange] to launched Bitcoin \\nfutures and began to offered daily contracts on Bitcoins futures. The unprecedented spike \\ndecreased about 45% to begin at $13,412.44 on 1 January 2018. By October 31, bitcoin price \\nhas declined to $6,300. The price could not hold on the $6,000 rally during a low volatility era, \\nhence fall to $4,000 in November. The BTC price steadily rose to $8721 by May 29 and later to \\n$12,500 in July. In 2019, BTC price which started with $3700 steadily rose and stood at $7200 by \\nDecember 31. The increase and volatility continues and by November 2020, as reported (CME \\nGroup, 2021 ; Finance.yahoo.com, 2021 ; Reuter Staff, 2017 ), the price rallied above $18,000 gaining \\nall losses from previous peak.\\nSince mid-2020, the role of information tweet in influencing the price of bitcoin price has been \\nmore pronounced. The September’s announcement by Canton of Zug (Switzerland) to accept tax \\npayments and Elon Musk’s tweet to accept bitcoin for Tesla’s car purchase caused bitcoin price to \\nskyrocket beyond previous 2017 peak (Browne, 2021 ). Tesla’s purchase of bitcoins of USD \\n$1.5 billion and announced plans to accept BTC for vehicle payment on 8 February 2021 pushed \\nthe bitcoin price to $44,141 (Li, 2021 ). Bitcoin worth over $62,000 USD in both February 2021 and \\nApril 2021 due to events and information which involve Tesla and Coinbase announcements. In \\nsame period, the Bitcoin market capitalisation reached its all-time high of over $1 trillion, and had \\nsince decline roughly around $600 billion in June 2021. At the moment, the price has \\nrevolved around $40,000.00 in late July, 2021.\\nFigure A1(a–f) represents plots for the observed daily Bitcoin price (01\\\\0115–11\\\\01\\\\21), and for \\ntwo different episodes (01\\\\0115–30\\\\06\\\\19) and (01\\\\0719–11\\\\01\\\\2021), as well as, for the first \\ndifference and for log daily price and log-difference price. The plots show that the price follows \\na nonlinear pattern. Bitcoin volatility reached about 8% in a 90 days span between October 2017 \\nand January of 2018. This is twice its volatility in a 28-day period from 17 December 2019 to \\n13 January 2020.\\n3.Empirical review\\nMost empirical literature on Bitcoin focus on: BTC price formation, relationship between BTC and \\nfinancial market assets, BTC as speculative bubbles, BTC shares in cryptocurrency market with \\nalternative crypto-asset, BTC time-of-day periodicities of trading, and the estimation of BTC price \\nGbadebo et al., Cogent Business & Management (2021), 8: 1984624                                                                                                                                 \\nhttps://doi.org/10.1080/23311975.2021.1984624                                                                                                                                                       \\nPage 3 of 21volatility. Some papers discuss factors that drive BTC price as macroeconomic and financial \\ndevelopment (Pyo & Lee, 2020 ); technology (Kjærland et al., 2018 ; Li & Wang, 2017 ) and the \\nmarket efficiency (Nadarajah & Chu, 2017 ).\\nOn relation with traditional assets, some studies (Bouri et al., 2018 ; Kurka, 2019 ; Smales, 2019 ) \\nclaim BTC holdings doe not serve as a safe haven for global assets, while Bouoiyour and Selmi \\n(2015 ) support that BTC serves as a safe haven, and hedges for oil price fluctuation. Matkovskyy \\nand Jalan (2019 ) argued that during financial crisis, risk-averse investors avoid Bitcoins as it is \\nconsidered riskier than other assets. Ji et al. (2019 ) argued that the attractiveness of Bitcoin is \\na major determinant of other cryptocurrencies. Some authors (Baur et al., 2018 ; Cheah & Fry, 2015 ; \\nCorbet et al., 2018 ) claimed that BTC is a speculative bubbles as its fundamental value cannot be \\nestimated or is equal to zero. Goutte et al. (2019 ) and Jeon et al. (2020 ) provided a survey on the \\nmechanisms of BTC exchange and crypto-finance, while Troster et al. (2018 ) analysed the implica -\\ntions of volatility for the BTC market. Some studies (Acharya et al., 2018 ; Baur et al., 2019 ; Eross \\net al., 2019 ; Koopman et al., 2005 ; O’Hara, 2015 ) focused on time-of-day periodicities of trading in \\nExchanges. Urquhart (2018 ) focused on the examination of price clustering, while some studies \\n(Hung et al., 2020 ; Troster et al., 2018 ) focused on the estimation of volatility models.\\nAvailable evidence (Aalborg et al., 2018 ; Cebrián-H & Jiménez-Rodríguez, 2021 ; Guizani & Nafti, \\n2019 ; Ji et al., 2019 ; Kjærland et al., 2018 ; Liang et al., 2020 ; Poyser, 2017 ; Wijk, 2013 ) discuss the \\ndeterminants of BTC price (BTCV) volatility. Wijk (2013 ) analysed the impact of macroeconomic- \\nand financial development factors on BTCV. He checks the impact of exchange rates, oil price and \\nmarket indices as Equity index, Dow-Jones index and Nikkei index on price volatility. The results \\nshows negative effects for oil price and Nikkei index, but positive effects both Equity index and DJ \\nindex on BTC price variability.\\nPoyser (2017 ) applied the Bayesian structural approach to analyse the effect of investor’s \\nsentiments, gold, and stock index on BTC price volatility. The results showed that the volatility \\nrelates positively with USD/Euro rate, stock index and difference among countries’ search trends, \\nwhile negatively associated with gold price, investor’s sentiment and Yuan/USD rate. Yechen et al. \\n(2017 ) applied a Vector error correction on monthly data to explain how BTC price volatility \\ndepends on custom price index, US dollar index, Dow jones index, Federal funds rate and gold \\nprice. They found that all variables have a long-term influence. Trade volume has positive effect on \\nBTC volatility price. The US dollar index is the biggest influencer, while gold is the least.\\nKjærland et al. (2018 ) applied the Autoregressive Distributed Lag (ARDL) model and generalized \\nautoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity (GARCH) approach to examine BTC price volatility. \\nThey identified that technological factor “Hashrate” is immaterial in modelling BTC price dynamics, \\nand verify the effect of Google searches, returns on S&P 500, volatility (VIX) index, oil price, gold \\nprice and BTC transaction volume on BTC prices. The Google searches and returns on S&P 500 have \\npositive and significant effect on BTC price volatility, while VIX, oil, gold, and volume to be \\ninsignificant. Aalborg et al. (2018 ) analysed the effect of transaction volume, VIX index and \\nGoogle searches for “Bitcoin” on the prediction of volatility of BTC price. They applied realized \\nvolatility computed from high-frequency data and found that the autoregressive model is suitable \\nfor BTC volatility. The trading volume variable shows a positive effect on the volatility model.\\nJi et al. (2019 ) explained the system of BTC exchanges relative to their common dynamics. They \\nconsidered the connectedness measures based on the daily realised volatility of BTC price. They \\nhypothesized that the positions of specific exchanges within the cryptocurrency network connect -\\nedness seems to be driven by individual’s exchange’s unique characteristics. The paper employed \\nhigh-frequency data that results reveal that while Binance exchange ranks is weak, the exchange \\n“Coinbase” leads the crypto market. The paper concluded that asset withdrawal explains more of \\nthe price volatility amongst individual exchanges than the trade volume.\\nGbadebo et al., Cogent Business & Management (2021), 8: 1984624                                                                                                                                 \\nhttps://doi.org/10.1080/23311975.2021.1984624\\nPage 4 of 21Guizani and Nafti (2019 ) explain the reason for excessive BTC price volatility. The paper employs \\nthe ARDL and the Granger causality on daily time series to dynamically explain how number of BTC \\naddresses, attractiveness indicator, mining difficulty, transaction volume, stock and EUR/USD rate, \\nmacroeconomic and financial development affect Bitcoin price volatility. The result suggests that \\nthe number of addresses and the mining difficulty have a significant impact on the BTC price \\nvolatility. The stock, the exchange rate, transaction volume and the macroeconomic and financial \\ndevelopment do not determine the price of the BTC in the short- and long term.\\nLiang et al. (2020 ) applied GARCH-MIDAS model to analyse the impact of VIX, Google Trends, and \\nGPR on bitcoin price and provide strong evidence that Google Trends exhibits strongest predict -\\nability for Bitcoin volatility over other competing predictors. Cebrián-H and Jiménez-Rodríguez \\n(2021 ) applied GARCH and multivariate GARCH (MGARCH) between 1 January 2011 and \\n31 December 2018 to consider the role of Gold, Brent oil, exchange rates, S&P500, Nikkei 225, \\nVISA and MasterCard transaction, Riot Blockchain, Nvidia on bitcoin prices. He discovered that \\nthere exist conditional correlation between the volatility of VISA, MasterCard, Riot Blockchain, \\nNvidia and Bitcoin, but not with the traditional assets as oil and gold.\\n4.Data and methodology\\n4.1. The data\\nThe data for this study are obtained from four sources: www.Google.trends.com , www.bitcoincharts. \\ncom ; www.nasdaq.com ; and www.Blockchain.com . In line with some studies (Aalborg et al., 2018 ; Ji \\net al., 2019 ; Kjærland et al., 2018 ; Yechen et al., 2017 ), we applied monthly data between 2013M6 and \\n2021M6. The bitcoin price adopted is the simple unweighted average of monthly closing price. We \\nfocused on the periods for which the volume of bitcoin transaction was considerably increased \\n(Kjærland et al., 2018 ), and the digital coin has gained attractions. Prior to June 2013, the attraction \\nand transactions volume of bitcoin were relatively low (Guizani & Nafti, 2019 ).\\nUnlike some studies (Dwyer, 2015 ; Kjærland et al., 2018 ; Wang et al., 2019 ) that considered \\nblockchain technology factor such as “Hash Rates” as determinant of bitcoin prices volatility, we \\nfocus solely on the effects of markets fundamental and information demand for the cryptocur -\\nrency. In sum, we employ Bitcoin price, Transaction volume, World market equity index, \\nCryptocurrency market capitalization, Information demands and the Bitcoin price volatility. The \\nvariables are in log form in accordance with analogous Bitcoin study by Pyo and Lee (2020 ). The \\nlogarithmic transformations are done to ensure that the cointegration relationship is preserved \\nwhile the heteroscedasticity is eliminated series. We discuss each variable in details.\\n4.1.1. Market fundamentals \\nThe supply and demand for Bitcoin, like other assets in the financial market and foreign exchange \\nmarket are the two main market fundamentals of price formations. Li and Wang (2017 ) notes that \\nthe demand indicator for BTCs have greater implication for its fluctuation than its reserves fixed \\nsupply. We follow some theoretical models on a positive relation between price volatility and \\ntrading volume in the financial markets. The common ones amongst these models are “mixture of \\ndistributions” models. Taylor (2017 ), “asymmetric information” models and “differences in opi-\\nnion” models. According to the “asymmetric information” models, investors submit trades based \\non available private information. As noted by Bian, Chan and Selgin (2015 ) as informed investors \\nincrease trade volume, volatility increases due to information generated. The literature on the \\n“differences in opinion” approach propound that relatively homogeneous beliefs drives excess \\nprice-volatility and excess volume, in relation to a more stable value of the asset.\\nUnlike asymmetric information, the proponents of the approach establishe that volatility-volume \\nconnection depends on who generates the volume, and why they are trading. Informed traders \\ntend to buy and sell within a relatively stable range of prices about the equilibrium value. Bian \\nfound that a positive volatility-volume relation is driven by the public investors in the futures \\nGbadebo et al., Cogent Business & Management (2021), 8: 1984624                                                                                                                                 \\nhttps://doi.org/10.1080/23311975.2021.1984624                                                                                                                                                       \\nPage 5 of 21markets for assets. For Bitcoin volatility-volume relation, found that the ability for investors to \\nwithdraw asset impacts more on the volatility through various Exchanges and trading volume. \\nBoth theoretical and empirical studies have focused on investigating the sources volatility-price \\nrelation and intraday price variations (Jiang et al., 2019 ). These models are based on market \\nmicrostructure that explore the mechanics of price formation and its relevance to market volatility. \\nThe model suggests that traditional volatility models can be augmented with the time-series of the \\ndaily price.\\nJiang et al. (2019 ) used a panel VAR estimation to examine the importance of price impact \\nresulting from the order book predicting stock volatility. They found that the price impact at the \\ndaily level is a major determinant of stock volatility dynamics. When the traditional volatility \\nmodels was augmented with the time-series of daily price impact, the volatility becomes more \\naccurately predicted at the one-day ahead forecasting horizon. The inclusion of the price variable \\nis needful as it as well helps improve the robustness of the model. Hence, as with some recent \\nnotable studies (Guizani & Nafti, 2019 ; Kjærland et al., 2018 ), we use BTC transaction volume \\n(TVOL) and BTC price (BTCP) as proxies for its fundamentals. We expect both BTCP and TVOL to \\nhave positive impact on Bitcoin price volatility.\\n4.1.2. Market capitalisation \\nThe market capitalization is a major factor that affects cryptocurrencies. Market capitalization is \\nobtained by multiplying the total number of Bitcoins in circulation by its own price. Lansky (2016 ) \\nconsidered the role of market capitalisation in in influencing the price of major cryptocurrencies. \\nYhlas (2018 ) applied an index of market capitalisation for 50 selected top coins. We would expect \\nthat a higher market capitalisation would provide a good chance for traders to get hands over \\nhigher profits. We use MCAP as proxies for cryptocurrencies market capitalization.\\n4.1.3. World market (equity) index \\nSome papers explain how volatility in globally asset markets transfer between markets and countries. \\nThese authors (Aalborg et al., 2018 ; Cebrián-H & Jiménez-Rodríguez, 2021 ; Guizani & Nafti, 2019 ; \\nJulio, 2017 ) incorporate financial development index or world market index—an indication of overall \\nglobal state of markets, which is expected to stimulate demand, hence causes increase in volatility. \\nSome studies applied the Equity index as Dow-Jones (DJ) index (Liang et al., 2020 ; Wijk, 2013 ; Yechen \\net al., 2017 ) and Nikkei 225 (Cebrián-H & Jiménez-Rodríguez, 2021 ; Poyser, 2017 ; Wijk, 2013 ), but we \\nincorporate the Morgan Stanley Capital International (MSCI)’s All Country World Index proxy as ACWI. \\nThe ACWI is a capitalization-weighted index, covering over 3,000 stocks, that measures global equity \\nperformance capturing both developed and emerging markets. We expect the ACWI to have positive \\nhigher impact on Bitcoin price volatility.\\n4.1.4. Information demands \\nInformation shock causes BTC price to spike beyond values consistent with fundamentals within \\nminutes of disclosure. Some empirical studies (Kjærland et al., 2018 ; Li & Wang, 2017 ; Poyser, \\n2017 ) considered how BTCV is affected by social network, news and search queries. Luu and Huynh \\napplied VAR and SVAR to confirm the role of ‘bad news and moving patterns on the spillover risks \\namongst cryptocurrency markets. While Pak and Paroubek (2010 ) and Abraham et al. (2018 ) focus \\non twitter tweets as a major source of information demand, we work in line with studies (Liang \\net al., 2020 ) that focus on Google search. In line with these authors, we verify how frequency of \\nqueries for the word “bitcoin” on Google-Trend explains erratic swings in its price. The Google \\nTrend reports the amount of search queries relative to the total amount of Google searches over \\ntime. This method generates values that are normalized on a scale from zero to 100.\\nWe favour the use of Google trend for two reasons. First, although both Google trend and Twitter \\ntweets show strong correlation with bitcoin prices but unlike Google trend tweets may fluctuate \\nwith prices in a different directions Abraham et al. (2018 ). The Google search is established to \\nexhibit strongest predictability for Bitcoin volatility over other competing search predictors (Liang \\nGbadebo et al., Cogent Business & Management (2021), 8: 1984624                                                                                                                                 \\nhttps://doi.org/10.1080/23311975.2021.1984624\\nPage 6 of 21et al., 2020 ). Second, as reported (Clement, 2020 ) Google accounted for 87.35% of global market \\nshares of search engine as of January, 2018. We expect high information search (IFOD) to have \\npositive impact on Bitcoin price volatility.\\n4.1.5. Bitcoin price volatility \\nWe adopt the historical volatility to compute the realised volatility for each month of our data span \\nusing available daily bitcoin price. Historical volatility is measured by applying ‘summing squared \\ndaily returns within each month. This method which applies the daily data BTCP dCt to compute \\nvolatility reduces the possibility of error of approximations and gives the accurate representation \\nand serves as guide for investors and analysts (Boyte-White, 2020 ). To obtain the volatility we first \\ncompute the daily BTCP returns series with BTCR dCt\\x88BTCP dCtEBTCP dCt\\x001\\x00 �\\nand use same calculate \\nthe realised volatility as summing squared daily returns within a 21-day time horizon defined \\nas: BTCV mCt\\x88∑n\\x8821\\nt\\x881BTCR dCt��2.\\nTable 1 presents a summary of variables for the empirical model.\\n4.2. The methodology\\nThis study estimates the relationship between the volatility of bitcoin prices and their attendant \\n(explanatory) variables. As applied in previous studies (Bariviera, 2017 ; Guizani & Nafti, 2019 ; \\nKjærland et al., 2018 ; Lahmiri et al., 2018 ), we adopt a Transfer-function —the Autoregressive \\nDistributed Lag, (ARDL) model which regresses the lag(s) of BTCV on contemporaneous BTCV. \\nThis model helps to apply monthly data to examine the short- and long-run factors that influence \\nprices of cryptocurrencies between 2013:M6 and 2021M6. Kjærland et al. (2018 ) employed the \\nARDL to show how the technological “Hashrate”, Google searches and BTC return influence Bitcoin \\nprice volatility. Guizani and Nafti (2019 ) adopted same to show how the number of BTC addresses, \\ntransaction volume and stocks drive BTC price volatility. The ARDL is considered as the major \\nworkhorse in dynamic single-equation estimation. We apply the ARDL, as well as its (cointegration) \\nBounds test to analyse how bitcoin market Fundamentals and Information demands explain the \\nerratic fluctuations in BTC prices. We summarise our estimation procedure in five steps.\\nFirst, we present statistics and verify the stochastic property of the data generating process \\n(DSG) with a unit root test for each time series (zt). We apply Augmented–Dickey–Fuller (ADF); \\nElliott–Rothenberg–Stock (ERS)’s DF–GLS, & Kwiatkowski–Phillips–Schmidt–Shin (KPSS) test.Table 1.

In estimating (6) we ignores the “l(1)-ness” of the series and estimate the \\nnonstationary series with least squares (Pesaran & Shin, 1999 ).\\nGbadebo et al., Cogent Business & Management (2021), 8: 1984624                                                                                                                                 \\nhttps://doi.org/10.1080/23311975.2021.1984624\\nPage 8 of 21Third , once we estimate (6), the next step is to verify if a long-run (equilibrium or cointegra -\\ntion) relationship exists amongst the l(0) or l(1) variables. We apply the ARDL (Cointegration) \\nBounds test procedure developed by Pesaran and Shin (1999 ), Pesaran et al. (2001 ), and \\nPesaran et al. (2001 ) introduce two (bounds) tests for cointegration: an F-test on the joint \\nnull that the coefficients on the level variables are jointly equal to zero or a t-test on the \\nlagged level dependent variable. In order to rule out the possibilities of degenerate cases and \\nobtain valid conclusion, both the F and t- test work under the that assumption the dependent \\nvariable is l(1). We adopt the F-test for our study. The bounds test check for cointegration by \\nestimating (a reparameterised) regression for Δyt:\\nΔyt\\x88β0\\x87φiyt\\x00i\\x87∑m\\nj\\x881φ�\\niΔyt\\x00i\\x87∑m\\nj\\x881βjxjCt\\x00i\\x87∑m\\nj\\x880γjCiB\\x85\\x86ΔxjCt\\x00i\\x87at (7) \\nThe test null H0Bφ\\x88βj\\x880Cj\\x881tom� �\\nis no cointegration exist. We estimate (8) to compute the \\nstatistic, Fmand compare with critical value bound (C.V.B.). Pesaran et al. (2001 ) propose two sets \\nof C.V.B. consistent to the polar cases of all variables being purely l0\\x85\\x86or ld\\x85\\x86, where d is order of \\nintegration. If Fm > Upper C.V.B., the null is rejected (cointegration exists) and vice versa.\\nFourth , if cointegration exist we next estimate the Cointegrating equation and Long run coeffi -\\ncients.

The model expresses the current \\nchange in the endogenous variable, Δyt as a linear function of the current change in the exogen -\\nous variable Δxt and a proportion of the previous error from the long-run “equilibrium”, ECM t\\x001. The \\nβj6s denote the long-run coefficients which represent the equilibrium effects of the xt on change in \\nthe dependent variable, Δyt. The γjCi’s are the short-run coefficients which account for fluctuations \\nthat are not determined by deviations from the long-run equilibrium. The (sign and) absolute value \\nof μ indicates the speed of adjustment. The t–statistic test on coefficients of the short run, γjCishows \\nthe impact of each variables on the dependent variable in the short run. We apply the least \\nsquares to estimate our models using the coefficient covariance method of HAC.\\nFifth since the ARDL equation comprises of l(1) variable(s), as argued by Borensztein et al. (1998 ), \\nit is required to check for heteroscedasticity and the serial correlation. To test the stability of the \\nlong run parameters estimates, we use the Cumulative Sum (CUSUM) and the Cumulative Sum of \\nSquare (CUSUMSQ) tests. This same procedure was relied on by Pesaran and Pesaran (Pesaran \\net al., 2001 ) to test the stability of the long-run coefficients. We check for existence of two \\nsignificant structural breakpoints using the Chow break point test. The first in December, 2017, \\nwhen the Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE) launched bitcoin futures contracts and \\nthe second is January, 2020, when the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) Group, the world’s \\nlargest derivatives exchange launch Bitcoin Options on its Bitcoin futures contracts.\\n5.The results\\n5.1. Descriptive statistics\\nTables 2 and Tables 3 present the descriptive statistics and the covariance-correlation matrix, respec -\\ntively. The result shows that the log of bitcoin price has a mean of 3.328 and a standard deviation of \\n0.768. Aside the bitcoin price and transaction volume, all the logarithmic distribution for other \\nvariables are asymmetric (positively skewed). The excess kurtosis for the price volatility and other \\nvariables aside the ACWI (with value slightly less than 2) suggests leptokurtic distribution for all series. \\nThe probability values for the Jarque Bera statistics for all variables show that all the series are not \\nGbadebo et al., Cogent Business & Management (2021), 8: 1984624                                                                                                                                 \\nhttps://doi.org/10.1080/23311975.2021.1984624                                                                                                                                                       \\nPage 9 of 21normally distributed, hence rejecting the normality null.

Unit root test\\nTable 4 presents the unit root test results. The unit root test applied Equations (1)–(3) to obtain τμ, \\nττ, and τη, respectively. The results indicate that aside two of the variables (bitcoin price volatility \\nand the world market equity index), there is enough evidence to conclude at 1 percent signifi -\\ncance level that other series (zt) are differenced stationary and l(1). For both ADF and DF-GLS test \\nprotocols, the null are accepted, while with the KPSS tests, the nulls of stationarity is rejected. The \\nevidence supports that first differenced (Δzt) are stationary for ADF and DF-GLS. This is not \\nsurprising as we would normally expect volatility, which is an offshoots of differencing not to \\nbe trended even for large swings. In the cryptocurrency market, unprecedented volatility are \\nconnected to reactions to information shocks. The existence of such headline-making bitcoin Table 2.

The result shows the vola -\\ntility of bitcoin price would be expected to increase by approximately 0.7% when markets \\nfundamentals (prices and volume vagaries) and information are not drivers of price swings. As \\nwould be expected bitcoin prices, transaction volume and market capitalisation are properly \\nsigned and significant in line with finding by Kjærland et al. (2018 ), and the information demands \\nis well signed and significant similar to finding by Poyser (2017 ). However, the all country world \\nindex was signed contrary to positive expectation and is not significant. This is contrary to findings \\nby Wijk (2013 ) who shows that the Dow jones index has positive effects on BTC price variability, \\nand Yechen et al. (2017 ) who established that both trade volume and Dow Jones index have \\npositive influence on bitcoin price volatility.\\nAll month-pasts bitcoin price volatility, bitcoin price and transactions volume in the parsimo -\\nnious model have negative effects on its contemporaneous price volatility value and not signifi -\\ncant, except for the previous bitcoin price. This indicates that the past play lesser roles in \\ninfluencing the contemporaneous value bitcoin price volatility. The significance of one-month \\npasts in previous prices imply that its effect on contemporaneous price volatility has not \\nwaned away.Table 5.

Table 9 presents the long run coefficients \\nobtained by normalizing the BTCV equation of (10). The results shows the long run effect of price of \\nbitcoin, transaction volume, market capitalisation, world market equity index and Google search \\nfor the bitcoin.\\nThe result shows that all the cryptocurrency market fundamentals, bitcoin price, transaction \\nvolume, and market capitalisation as well as the information search for Bitcoin positively affect \\nBitcoin in long run. A significant positive long run coefficient of transaction volume on a bitcoin \\nexchange reduce the risk of it failing suggesting that trade volume would likely provide ability to \\nexplain the price volatility of bitcoin. Similar to the short run and the ARDL model, we found again \\nthat both BTC price and volume explain more of the BTC price volatility than information Table 7.

A 1% increase in Bitcoin price and transactions volume lead to respectively, 0.44% and \\n0.29% increase in Bitcoin price volatility, all things being equal, while a 1% increase in information \\nsearch leads 0.21% increase in Bitcoin price swings.\\nThis findings support earlier position of Guizani and Nafti (2019 ) bitcoin price long-run position. \\nWe found that the world market index, which is supposed to stimulate demand has negative long- \\nrun effect on BTC price volatility. This may be attributed to the fact that the period covers has not \\nrecognised institution and regulation of the digital currency. Except for coefficient of world market \\nindex, kθ4, all other long-run coefficients are significant at 5%. As noted (Briere et al., 2015 ), \\na significance coefficient of world market index is an indication that there is protection to investors \\nwho want to limit their risk exposure. There is at least 97% confidence that bitcoin price, transac -\\ntion volume, market capitalisation and information explains the volatility of Bitcoin price in the \\nlong run.\\n5.7. Robustness test\\nWe assess the appropriateness of the ARDL model by conducting some residual checks to verify \\ntheir randomness. We examined the structural stability of the long-run coefficients alongside the \\nshort-run dynamics. Our results confirm the adequacy of the estimation. Table 10 presents the \\nresult of the same robustness tests.\\nThe Breusch-Pagan-Godfrey test is not significant and hence support evidence that there is \\nabsence of heteroscedasticity. In addition, the Breusch-Godfrey test is not significant providing no \\nbasis to reject the no serially correlation null. With a p-value (0.526) the normality null of \\ndistributed stochastic errors is not rejected. The CUSUM plot in Figure A1 1(a) indicates structural \\nstability in the long run coefficients.

In effects, we checked the influence of price, transaction volume, \\nworld equity market index, market capitalisation and Google search on the volatility of Bitcoin \\nprice. Similar to Guizani and Nafti (2019 ), we observed a long-run equilibrium relationship between \\nBTC price volatility and attendant variables. We could not establish evidence that the volatility of Table 11.

First is that stakeholders \\nin the cryptocurrency markets should embark on campaigns to encourage more institutional \\nacceptance. Second is that there should be increased regulation in order to curb excessive swings \\nthat may significantly affect funds invested in Bitcoin. Third is there should be establishment of \\na Bitcoin insurance in form of a Decentralised Insurance Product (DIP) that would assure investors \\nof the safety of funds invested in Bitcoin.\\nThis study opens rooms for future research. We limited our focus on the determinants of Bitcoin \\nprice volatility. We do not distinct Bitcoin as money or an asset, rather we considered bitcoin in this \\npaper as both a product in a currency exchange market or a security in an asset market. Future \\nresearch may make distinctions. There may be need to investigate the role of data frequency on \\nthe outcome. Future research may focus on infra-monthly data to confirm the sensitivity of Bitcoin \\nprice volatility to data periodicity.\\nFunding\\nThe authors received no direct funding for this research.\\nAuthor details\\nAdedeji Daniel Gbadebo1 \\nE-mail: gbadebo.adedejidaniel@gmail.com \\nAhmed Oluwatobi Adekunle2 \\nE-mail: tobiahamed@gmail.com \\nWole Adedokun4 \\nE-mail: woledokun@yahoo.com \\nAdebayo-Oke Abdulrauf Lukman5 \\nE-mail: okelukman2003@yahoo.com \\nJoseph Akande3 \\nE-mail: jakande@nust.na \\n1 Department of Economics and Statistics, University of \\nBenin, Benin City, Nigeria. \\n2 Depar tment of Accounting and Finance, Kwara State \\nUniversity, Ilorin, Nigeria. \\n3 Department of Accounting Science, Walter Sisulu \\nUniversity, Mthatha, South Africa. \\n4 Department of Accounting and Finance, Institute of \\nGraduate Studies and Research, Cyprus International \\nUniversity, Nicosia, Turkey. \\n5 Department of Accounting and Finance, Kwara State \\nUniversity, Ilorin, Nigeria.\\nCitation information \\nCite this article as: BTC price volatility: Fundamentals versus \\ninformation, Adedeji Daniel Gbadebo, Ahmed Oluwatobi \\nAdekunle, Wole Adedokun & Adebayo-Oke Abdulrauf \\nLukman , Cogent Business & Management (2021), 8: 1984624.\\nNote\\n1. ~βjCi is an input polynomial lag expressed \\nas:-\\n~βjB\\x85\\x86\\x88~βjC0\\x87~βjC1B\\x87~βjC2B2\\x87\\x87~βjCsj\\x001Bsj\\x001\\x88\\x00∑Sj\\nl\\x88i\\x871βjCl-\\nkβj\\x88kβjC0\\x87444\\x87kβjCsj; and εt\\x88φ\\x001B\\x85\\x86atLet \\nθ0\\x88φ\\x0011\\x85\\x86K0; θj\\x88φ\\x0011\\x85\\x86Kj1\\x85\\x86; \\n~θjB\\x85\\x86\\x88φ\\x001B\\x85\\x86~βjB\\x85\\x86\\x00~φB\\x85\\x86φ\\x0011\\x85\\x86Kj1\\x85\\x86� �\\n. \\nCompeting interests\\nThe author declare not competing interest.Disclosure statement\\nNo potential conflict of interest was reported by the author(s).\\nReferences\\nAalborg, H.
